# Bank Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This Jupyter notebook contains a comprehensive analysis of bank customer churn data, focusing on understanding and predicting customer attrition patterns.

## Objectives
1. Data Profiling & Exploration
2. Statistical Analysis
3. Predictive Modeling
4. Customer Insights Generation

## Dataset Description
The analysis uses the 'Bank_Churn.csv' dataset which includes various customer attributes:
- Demographic information
- Banking relationship metrics
- Customer behavior patterns
- Churn status (Target variable: 'Exited')

## Technical Implementation
### Libraries Used:
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib/seaborn: Data visualization
- scikit-learn: Machine learning implementations
- numpy: Numerical computations

### Analysis Components:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data type optimization
   - Missing value analysis
   - Feature engineering

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Scatter plot matrices for numeric variables
   - Box plots for target variable analysis
   - Bar charts for categorical variable distributions
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Distribution analysis
   - Relationship studies between variables

4. **Visualization**
   - Customer segmentation visualizations
   - Churn pattern analysis
   - Feature importance plots

5. **Modelling**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Regression 

6. **Evaluation Metrics**
    - Classification_report
    - Confusion matrix
    - ROC-AUC Score
